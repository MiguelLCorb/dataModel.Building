# Building Data Models


This folders contains a number of data models related to the modelling of
Building and its management based on
[GSMA](https://www.gsma.com/iot/iot-big-data/) activities. Compared to GSMA
models, we introduced some changes and removed the `BuildingType` model.

The following entity types are supported:

-   [`Building`](https://swagger.lab.fiware.org/?url=https://smart-data-models.github.io/dataModel.Building/master/Building/swagger.yaml): A Building is a human build structure where different activities
    occur related to living, working, healing and so on.
-   [`BuildingOperation`](https://swagger.lab.fiware.org/?url=https://smart-data-models.github.io/dataModel.Building/master/BuildingOperation/swagger.yaml): It captures automated operations that may be ongoing
    within a building.
