# dataModel.Building
This folders contains a number of data models related to the modelling of Building and its management based on [GSMA](https://www.gsma.com/iot/iot-big-data/) activities.

### List of data models

The following entity types are available:
- [Building](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.Building/blob/master/Building/README.md). Information on a given Building

- [BuildingOperation](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.Building/blob/master/BuildingOperation/README.md). Information on a given Building Operation

- [BuildingType](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.Building/blob/master/BuildingType/README.md). This entity contains a harmonised description of a generic building type. This entity is associated with the vertical segments of smart home, smart cities, industry and related IoT applications. The building type includes a hierarchical structure that allows building types to be grouped in a flexible way.

- [VibrationsObserved](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.Building/blob/master/VibrationsObserved/README.md). The vibrations observed in a specific place.



### Incubated data models
The list of incubated (on development) data models are:

  - [Enclosure_incubated](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.Building/tree/master/Enclosure_incubated)

  - [Floor_incubated](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.Building/tree/master/Floor_incubated)
